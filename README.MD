# serverless-parcel

Serverless plugin for zero-config [parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org/) support.

## Install

```
yarn add serverless-parcel --dev
```

Add the plugin to your `serverless.yml`:

```
plugins:
  - serverless-parcel
```

## Configure

None required! By default, parcel will build your lambda functions with parcel... but if you want to get fancy, here ya go:

```yml
custom:
  parcel:
    ## options for lambda functions
    options:
      ## defaults
      target: node
      cache: false
      watch: false
      bundleNodeModules: true
      outDir: autogenerated - you can't change this

    ## non-lambda entries you'd like to build
    entries:
      # an array of bundler options with an entry file
      - file: src/index.html
        minify: true
        target: browser
      - file: src/admin.html
        minify: false
        sourceMaps: true
```

A full list of options can be found on [parcel's api docs](https://parceljs.org/api.html)

## Shout Out

This project was heavily inspired by [serverless-plugin-typescript](https://github.com/prisma/serverless-plugin-typescript) and [serverless-webpack](https://github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack). Both are epic projects and I hope this projects grows up to be like them one day. :tada:
